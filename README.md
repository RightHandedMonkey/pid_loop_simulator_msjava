PID Trainer
---------------

This program is used to interactively demonstrate a PID loop (proportional, integral, derivative) from any computer that has the Microsoft JVM installed.
These loops are typically used in building automation and process control systems, but can be very difficult to intuitively understand how changing the different factors affects the loop performance.

The code was created using Microsoft Visual J++ and can be loaded as a J++ project
Compiled Binaries are stored at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidloopsimulato/

INSTALLATION:

1. Download & Install the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, which can be found at: 
  http://www.oldversion.com/Microsoft-Java-VM.html
	  or
	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/477489/MSJAVX86.EXE

2. PID Trainer.exe -- Run the program after the MS JVM is installed.

PREQUISITE NOTES:

Run the MSJAVX86.exe to install the Microsoft JVM (no longer supported by Microsoft - sorry for the outdated version, but the graphical scroll feature was not easy to duplicate to .NET).  If you would like to request an update or to help update the code, please drop me a line through the sourceforge project page.
