Download & Install the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, which can be found at: \r\n  http://www.oldversion.com/Microsoft-Java-VM.html\r\n\t  or\r\n\thttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/477489/MSJAVX86.EXE\r\n\r\n2. PID Trainer.exe -- Run the program after the MS JVM is installed.\r\n\r\nPREQUISITE NOTES:\r\n\r\nRun the MSJAVX86.exe to install the Microsoft JVM (no longer supported by Microsoft - sorry for the outdated version, but the graphical scroll feature was not easy to duplicate to .NET).  If you would like to request an update or to help update the code, please drop me a line through the sourceforge project page.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
